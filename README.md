**`Cyber Security Analyst`**

I am Cybery Security Analyst looking to break into the Cyber Security industry. I build real world scenarios in lab environments to learn the ins and outs of tools necessary to analyze threats and mitigate future incidents. When I am not actively gaining hands on experience with such tools as Sentinel, Splunk, Wazuh, or Azure, I am studying to become more knowledgeable in the Cyber Security space.
